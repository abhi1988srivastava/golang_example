golang_example
==============

Go language is a programming language developed at google.It is a statically typed language with the syntax from C having the capabilities of concurrency, programmer free memory management and a large standard library.It is an open source so any modification can be proposed by any user. I have also uploaded an ebook which covers basics of Golang. This repository contains some basic examples of golang which helps to understand the concepts of golang.
